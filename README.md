## Historical Background

The Kelly Criterion was invented by Claude Shannon and popularized by Ed Thorp who used it to successfully optimize his wager sizes for gambling games that offered a positive expected value.  The Kelly Criterion is the fraction of total wealth to wager on an individual positive expected value bet such that the expected logarithm of total wealth after repeated wagers is maximized.  Smaller bet sizes lead to wins which do not compound as quickly, and larger bet sizes suffer from an increased risk of ruin.  For more details on the Kelly Criterion, see https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kelly_criterion

Ed Thorp would later extend the mathematics of the Kelly Criterion to handle multiple correlated positive expected value bets, i.e. a portfolio of stocks.  The fraction of wealth allocated to each asset is known as the Kelly Portfolio which optimizes the long term compound growth rate of total wealth.  Thorp used the Kelly Portfolio to produce 20% annualized returns over 28 years at his asset management firm, Princeton-Newport Partners, wagering over $80 billion during those years with an average of 100 simultaneous bets of $65,000.  Legendary investors Bill Gross and Warren Buffett have also reportedly used Kelly optimal methods for portfolio management.
